The Montana Army National Guard's (MTARNG) Defensive Cyber Operations Element (DCOE) provided training, cyber familiarization, and a resilience review report to Montana State University (MSU) faculty, staff, students, and Guard leadership on Sept. 5-6 in Bozeman, Montana. This initiative was part of the [Innovative Readiness Training program](https://irt.defense.gov/).

Ryan Knutson, MSU Vice President of Information Technology, praised the training, saying, "This joint effort was a valuable opportunity for both our cybersecurity students and IT staff. Collaborating with the Montana National Guard allowed us to enhance our skills in a constantly evolving field."

Lt. Col. Tony Lecce, DCOE Mission Command Supervisor, added, "We were able to provide this training at no cost to MSU, thanks to federal funding, saving approximately $383,500. The experience was invaluable for our soldiers, offering real-world scenarios that can't be replicated in a lab setting."

The MTARNG has openings in information technology, signal, and cyber career fields across Montana. These roles offer industry-standard training, certifications, and great benefits. For more information, contact a local recruiter or call 406-324-3164.
