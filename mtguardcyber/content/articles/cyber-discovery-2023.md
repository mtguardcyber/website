The Montana National Guard Cyber Defense Team worked with the Idaho National Guard and eight other participating states in a cybersecurity exercise at Gowen Field, Idaho, May 2023 as part of Cyber Discovery, a regional cyber exercise focused on security operations, incident tracking and response. 

Exercise participants recieved formal training from [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) on their [Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (RVA)](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/risk-and-vulnerability-assessments) methodology, and then conducted an RVA assessment of an Idaho Public Sector organization, led by the Idaho Army National Guard DCOE. The exercise taook place within the framework of the Department of Defenseâ€™s [Innovative Readiness Training program](https://irt.defense.gov/).

Training like this helps improve cybersecurity across the state and provides valuable red team training to Montana Guardsmen.
