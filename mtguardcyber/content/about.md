Created in 2018, the Montana Army National Guard (MTARNG) Cyber Team is the Montana Guard's cyber asset. Our mission set includes DODIN defense, public sector incident response, and public sector assessment and engagement with Montana institutions and organizations.

For the [Montana Guard](https://montanaguard.gov/), the Cyber Team serves as a defensive force and Subject Matter Expert for cyber operations, providing input to stakeholders regarding cyber effects on operations. The Cyber Team is an active partcipant in the [State Partnership Program](https://www.nationalguard.mil/Leadership/Joint-Staff/J-5/International-Affairs-Division/State-Partnership-Program/), collaborating with international partners on cybersecurity topics and enhancing US representation abroad.

For the Montana Public Sector, the Cyber Team serves as a free asset for advice and expertise on cybersecurity principles, and conducts organizational policy and procedure assessments through [CISA's Cyber Resiliency Review](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/cyber-resilience-review-crr) and vulnerability assessments through [CISA's Risk and Vulnerability Assessment](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/risk-and-vulnerability-assessments) methodology. To date, the MTARNG Cyber Team has conducted assessments with 5 Montana public sector organizations and helped secure 5 separate network enclaves.
