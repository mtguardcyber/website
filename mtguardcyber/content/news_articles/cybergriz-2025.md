🛡💻CyberGriz 2025: A Joint Mission in Cybersecurity Readiness

From penetration testing to malware analysis, students rotated through interactive stations, gaining real-world insight into defending critical infrastructure. The Montana Army National Guard's (MTARNG) Cyber Team conducted a Student Engagement day and VIP brief to University of Montana (UM) faculty, staff, students, and Guard leadership on September 4-5 2025 on the UM Main Campus in Missoula, Montana.

The event was a cap on an [Innovative Readiness Training (IRT)](https://irt.defense.gov/) project — strengthening both our state’s cyber defenses and the next generation of cybersecurity leaders. Dubbed "CyberGriz", The IRT project had the MTARNG Cyber Team conduct a [CRR](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/cyber-resilience-review-crr) at UM's main campus, [CPG assessments](https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals) at its satellite campuses, and a [RVA Penetration Test](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/risk-and-vulnerability-assessments) of the UM campus network in coordination with UM staff and faculty.

🎙“We’re proud to work alongside UM to deliver training that benefits both our Guard units and Montana’s students,” said Lt Col Antonio L. Lecce, Army Chief Information Officer/G-6 for the Montana Army National Guard.

The MTARNG has openings in information technology, signal, and cyber career fields across Montana. These roles offer industry-standard training, certifications, and great benefits. For more information, contact a local recruiter or visit [The MTARNG Recruiting Website](https://montanaguard.net/).
