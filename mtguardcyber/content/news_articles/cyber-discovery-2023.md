The Montana National Guard Cyber Team worked with the Idaho National Guard and eight other participating states in a cybersecurity exercise at Gowen Field, Idaho, May 2023 as part of Cyber Discovery, a regional cyber exercise focused on security operations, incident tracking, and incident response.

Exercise participants recieved formal training from [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) on their [Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (RVA)](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/risk-and-vulnerability-assessments) methodology, and then conducted an RVA assessment of an Idaho Public Sector organization, led by the Idaho Army National Guard DCOE.

The exercise took place within the framework of the Department of Defenseâ€™s [Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) program](https://irt.defense.gov/). IRT Projects provide National Guardsmen with valuable training and collaboration with Public Sector partners to improve public sector services and organzations, while being free-of-charge for the participating public sector partners.

Training like this helps improve cybersecurity across the state and provides valuable red team training to Montana Guardsmen.
